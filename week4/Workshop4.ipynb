    "In machine learning and data science, we often have vectors where the length doesn't matter much but the direction is important.  In a situation like this, if we want to measure how similar two vectors are, we might just look at the angle between the vectors.  In fact, we can use the cosine of the angle as a measure of the similariy.  A cosine of 1 means the vectors point in the same direction, 0 means they are orthogonal, and -1 means they point in opposite directions.  This is called **cosine similarity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example where cosine similarity gets used frequently is in text analysis.  We might compare the relative frequencies of words or letters.  Does one document use consonants more than vowels when compared to another?  Suppose one text has 100 consonants and 78 vowels, while another has 200 consonants and 160 vowels.  The second text is twice as long, so the distance between the points (100,78) and (200,160) might be large, but the ratios 100/78 = 1.28 and 200/160 = 1.25 are very close.  Eventhough their lengths are very different, these two vectors point in nearly the same direction and so their cosine siilarity is close to 1.  \n",
